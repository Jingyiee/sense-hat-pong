By coding a Pong game with your Raspberry Pi and Sense HAT, you will learn:

- How to illuminate Sense HAT pixels
- How to use curses to capture the joystick input
- How to use threading in a game to keep a pixel moving

This resource covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/):

- [Combine programming constructs to solve a problem](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/builder)
- [Combine inputs and/or outputs to create projects or solve a problem](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/physical-computing/builder)
