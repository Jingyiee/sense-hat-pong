## Introduction

### What you will make
In this activity you will create a Pong game using your Raspberry Pi and a Sense HAT, along with some Python code. Pong is one of the oldest graphical games ever created, and was originally played on an oscilloscope.

Use the arrow keys to control your paddle. Don't let the ball touch the edge or you will lose the game!

### What you will learn
By coding a Pong game with your Raspberry Pi and Sense HAT, you will learn:

- How to illuminate Sense HAT pixels
- How to detect when the Sense HAT joystick is moved
