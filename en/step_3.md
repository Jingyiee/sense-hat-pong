## Make a Pong clone for your Sense HAT

In this activity you will build your own Pong clone using your Raspberry Pi, a Sense HAT, and some Python code.

Pong was one of the earliest graphical games ever created, and could even be played on an oscilloscope.

If you don't have a Sense HAT to use with this tutorial, you can use the Sense HAT emulator. To install this, open a terminal window by pressing `Ctrl + Alt + T`. Type the following command:

``` bash
sudo pip3 install sense-emu
```

To start the emulator, you can type `sense_emu_gui` in the terminal window.
