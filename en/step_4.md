## Graphics and coordinates

When we create graphical games, we often use the coordinates `x` and `y` to tell us where an object is on the display. `x` is used to set the horizontal position of an object, and `y` is used to set the vertical position of an object.

We can do the same with the LEDs on the Sense HAT.

At the **top-left** corner, both x and y would have values of `0`.
