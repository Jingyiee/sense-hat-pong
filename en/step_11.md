# Challenge: make it harder

+ Add a score which increases each time the ball bounces off the bat. Report the score to the player when they lose.

+ Make the game easier or harder by changing the `sleep` period in the `while` loop.

+ Give the player three lives. Each time they miss the ball they lose a life and the ball resets. Once all lives are lost, the game ends.
